      <h5>Biggest Impacts of Corona Virus</h5>
      <p>Transition students feel that the largest impacts of Corona Virus on their future college experiences include: not being able to visit colleges for campus tours, attending classes virtually, difficulties making friends, not receiving full college experience, and worries about where they will live. Some sample quotes are shown below.</p>
      <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          <q>I won't be able to go to a dorm and get a real college experience because I'll be learning from home.</q><br><br>
          <q>I feel like I'm not going to choose the right college for me especially when it comes to the campuses since I can't visit them. I feel like if I had a physical connection with college students and went on tour guides I would feel more close and at home to where I want to attend.</q><br><br>
          <q>I won't be able to have the full college experience of meeting new people and making friends given the circumstances. I am concerned in general that some opportunities will become unavailable for health reasons.</q><br><br>
          <q>Whether I will be able to smoothly transition to living in dorms of my college choice when the time comes with this pandemic occurring.</q><br><br>
          <q>Are all classes going to virtual? Will I have to pay fees that I didn't receive/do? How would clubs work? How will I be able to make friends if everything is virtual? </q>
        </blockquote>
      </figure>

      <p>Success students' primary concern from Corona virus is not learning enough or being engaged enough with online courses. Some students are also concerned about paying for college. Finally, some Success students entered their college career during the pandemic, so they've been fully virtual since the beginning. These students are also concerned about going to campus, finding a place to live and making friends. Some quotes are below.</p>
      <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          <q>I am afraid that I have not learned anything useful when all classes are fully remote. In-person classes are much better.</q><br><br>
          <q>Corona virus has halted all in-person clubs and events (rightfully so). However, a big part of community building came from those events and there hasn't been the same level of connection since these events moved to a virtual platform.</q><br><br>
          <q>I don't want to be rushed onto campus. I hope that when we do return to campus it will be safe.</q><br><br>
          <q>I couldn't really find a group of friends since I stayed home for this first year... its also hard having a relationship with professors and comfortably getting the help needed.</q><br><br>
          <q>College still requires students to pay the same amount of tuition during this time. </q>

      <h5>Most Impactful LGR Resources</h5>
      <p>Transition students found that resources and help surrounding the college application process was most imapctful. This includes help practicing for the SAT, writing the college essay and applying for scholarships and financial aid. Some quotes include:</p>
      <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          <q>The list of scholarships my coach had available for me was great.</q><br><br>
          <q>Support on choosing schools and motivating me to meet deadlines and do essays.</q><br><br>
          <q>I was able to have an outlet outside of school to ask questions to about college. I liked knowing I had someone else there for me in case someone else was busy or not responding.</q><br><br>
          <q>To stay on top of deadlines and to go outside of my comfort zone when applying to colleges and scholarships. </q><br><br>
          <q>How It’s best to be my true self when I try to make friends in college.  And some tips on how to get along with professor as well as attending office hours! Especially going to tutoring when needed likewise with office hours.</q>
        </blockquote>

      <p>On the other hand, Success students found that coach check-ins were the most helpful resource. Specifically, Success students appreciated reminders about time management and positive advice about staying motivated and self care. Similar to Transition students, Success students appreciated receiving help finding and applying to scholarships and FASFA.</p>
      <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          <q>My coach advice on time management and I found that strongly helpful because I procrastinate most times . </q><br><br>
          <q>To relax and when needed do some meditation or talk to a therapist.</q><br><br>
          <q>The most helpful area of support was managing my stress.</q><br><br>
          <q>My coach would always text me around finals week, specifically first semester, reminding me about on campus resources I could go to if I was stressed.</q><br><br>
