      <h3>Descriptive Plots</h3>
      <p>Most survey questions assessed to what degree students' and coaches' agreed  with a statement. For each plot below, the question statement is shown in the top left corner of the plot. The frequency of each response ("Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Disagree", "Strongly Disagree") is plotted using bar graphs. You may hover over a bar to view the absolute value of the bar.</p>

    <hr style="width:110%; border-top: 2px dotted gray; background-color:transparent!important; margin: 1.5em 0 1.5em 0;">

    <div class="row text-white">
      <h3>Coach and Program Satisfaction</h3>
      <p>Almost all students, in both Transition and Success programs, felt they had a strong relationship with their coach. Furthermore, most students also stated that they were likely to recommend their coach to other LGR students.</p>
    </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div id="coach_relationship" style="text-shadow: none;"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div id="coach_recommendation" style="text-shadow: none;"></div>
        </div>

        <p style="color: white; margin: 1em 0 1em 0;">Perhaps as a result of having such a positive relationship with their coaches, students are also very likely to recommend the LGR program.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div id="program_recommendation" style="text-shadow: none;"></div>

    <div class="row text-white">
      <h3>College Plans</h3>
      <p>The following questions were asked <strong>only</strong> to Transition students.</p>
      <p>Most Transition students have decided to go to college immediately following high school graduation. Additionally, almost all students agreed that college is the right decision for them. </p> 
    </div>


      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div id="college_plans" style="text-shadow: none;"></div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div id="college_decision" style="text-shadow: none;"></div>
        </div>

        <p style="color: white; margin: 1em 0 1em 0;">Most students rated their readiness for college as "Somewhat Agree". It's unclear whether this slight uncertainty is due to normal pre-college jitters or if COVID-19 has played a larger role in making students feel nervous about attending college. If data from previous years is available, it may be interesting to compare students' college readiness from this cohort to students of previous years.</p>
        <p style="color: white; margin: 1em 0 1em 0;">Despite some slight hesitation towards feeling ready for college, almost all students are confident that they will graduate.</p>

      <h3>Coronavirus Impact</h3>
      <p>The perceived impact of coronavirus is shown below. Students' ratings are shown on the LEFT and coach ratings are shown on the RIGHT. </p>
      <p>Success students rated coronavirus as having a larger impact on their college plans/experiences than Transition students. This may be because Success students were likely already in college and living in dormitories. Coronavirus not only caused an interruption to their schooling, but also dirupted their living situation, assuming that the students were required to return home. Transition students, who are presumably still in high school and already living at home, were less impacted.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, however, coaches seemed to rate the impact of coronavirus on their students in the inverse. For example, Transition coaches rated the effect of COVID-19 on their students as higher than the coaches of Success students.</p>
