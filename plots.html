      <h1>Bar Plots</h1>
        <p>Almost all students, in both transition and success programs, felt they had a strong relationship with their coach, as well as recommending their coaches. Transition students have a more even mix between "Strongly Agree" and "Agree" to recommend their coach. As a result of these positive experiences, most of students recommend the program.</p>

      <h1>Transition Students' Progress</h1>
        <p>Most transition students have made their decision on colleges. There is an even mixed between transition students feeling ready for college and then the others are somewhat ready. 
          This can indicate that students are still not fully ready for college and there are still some factors that are holding them back. </p>
          
        <p>Majority of students plan to attend college this upcoming fall semester, and almost all students are confidence that they will graduate. </p>

      <h1>Corona Virus Impacts on Students and Coaches</h1>
         <p>Interestingly, success students rated coronavirus as having a larger impact on their college plans/experience than Transition students. This is likely because success students, most of whom were already enrolled in college, likely had to return home. Transition students, who are still in high school, were still living at home at the time so were less impacted.</p>
         <p>Interestingly, when Transition coaches were asked about the impact of coronavirus on their students, coaches tended to rate the impact higher as shown by the distribution centered around "A lot".</p>
